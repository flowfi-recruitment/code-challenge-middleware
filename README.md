### Transactions API

This codebase is a fairly representative example of what a middleware micro-service looks like at FlowFi.

**The Stack:**
* AWS AppSync (GraphQL)
* AWS Lambda (Node/Typescript)
* AWS RDS (Postgres) 

**The Scenario**:

* Assume there is a database with three tables, Transactions, Merchants and Categories each with the columns as described in the diagram.
* The purpose of this service is to provide an API to the client UI application so that it can securely query transactions.

**The Challenge**:

* Please refer to the assessment worksheet you were given for specific instructions.
* Generally, please familiarize yourself with the codebase and submit a PR with feedback and corrections as though this was a real collaboration.
